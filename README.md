# microCore
microCore is a hardware/software co-design environment based on Forth and VHDL.

The hardware is a dual stack, deterministic, real-time processor for embedded FPGA applications.<BR>
The software is a co-design environment consisting of a cross-compiler and an interactive debugger.

Documentation is in microCore/documents:
