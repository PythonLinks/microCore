*** XP2_2200  21-Jan-2021 ks

First release on GitHub.

New Version number structure:
<4 digit version>_<2 digit data_width>
<major_release><functionality_added><HW_fix><SW_fix>_<data_width>
Use .version to display while debugging.

In architecture_pkg.vhd and architecture_pkg_sim.vhd:
- Simplification and re-arrangment of the architecture Constants.
- Additional number formats implemented in vhdl.fs e.g. 16#C00#.
- data_nibbles renamed octetts.
- dcache_addr_width renamed cache_addr_width.
- pcache_addr_width deleted, its now always equal to prog_addr_width.
  The notion that there may be external program memory available has
  been given up.

In uCntrl.vhd:
- The return stack may now reside in external memory.
  Its base address is defined by constant addr_rstack.
- op_WLOCAL and op_RLOCAL have been abandoned for op_LOCAL, which
  only computes the absolute memory address from a relative return
  stack addr.
- Overflow bugfix in op_SDIVS.

In constants.fs: Compound names in uForth did use the _ character as
separator. This has been replaced by the - character unless a name has
been imported from VHDL verbatim. Example: #c_bitout renamed #c-bitout.

Library.fs: New file that implements uForth's library mechanism.
See uForth.pdf chapter 9.6 "Libraries". Library code integrated into
microcross.fs.

*** uCore 2.10  17-Jun-2020 ks

First release (CERN and DESY).

During documentation, several changes have been made to the design.
And a new version identification when displaying

.version: 2<2-digit-design#>_<data_width> e.g. 210_32

*** uCore 2.02  07-Jan-2020 ks

Shift instructions unified:

WITH_TASKS, TASK_REG, tld, t@, tst, and t! eliminated.
Upload bug fixed.
status, dsp, rsp became registers. Special purpose instructions
status@/!, dsp@/!, and rsp@/! eliminated.
+sat instruction added.
