# microCore
microCore is a hardware/software co-design environment based on Forth and VHDL.

The hardware is a dual stack, deterministic, real-time processor for embedded FPGA application.

The software is a co-design environment consisting of a cross-compiler and an interactive debugger.

Documentation is in microCore/documents:

uCore_overview.pdf	    brief description of its architecture.
uCore_instructions.pdf	brief description of its instruction set.
uCore.pdf		            processor manual explaining how to work with it.
uForth.pdf		          description of uCore's assembler and cross-compiler/debugger.
Getting_started.pdf	    necessary steps for a first uCore simulation.
uCore_Exploratory_License.pdf free license for research and development.

A commercial license for saleable products with an embedded microCore will follow.
