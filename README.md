# microCore
microCore is a hardware/software co-design environment based on Forth and VHDL.

The hardware is a dual stack, deterministic, real-time processor for embedded FPGA applications.<BR>
The software is a co-design environment consisting of a cross-compiler and an interactive debugger.

Documentation is in microCore/documents:

file | content
------------ | -------------
uCore_overview.pdf | brief description of its architecture.<BR>
uCore_instructions.pdf | brief description of its instruction set.<BR>
uCore.pdf | processor manual explaining how to work with it.<BR>
uForth.pdf | description of uCore's assembler and cross-compiler/debugger.<BR>
Getting_started.pdf | necessary steps for a first uCore simulation.<BR>
uCore_Exploratory_License.pdf | free license for research and development.

License:

There will be two types of licenses, an exploratory and a commercial license.<BR>
Under the exploratory license, you can freely use microCore for research and development.<BR>
A commercial license for saleable products with an embedded microCore will follow soon.
